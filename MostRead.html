          <h4><a name="#"></a>Google updates Pixel 2 XL with new ‘saturated’ color display option and other bug fixes.</a></h4>
            <p>The regular, monthly patches for the Pixel are one of the main reasons to buy a Google phone instead of another Android device. This month, however, the company has done more than add the usual security fixes. For the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, it has also layered on a bunch of bug fixes and new features. The most important of which, as Android Central reports, are new options for color saturation. It also contains “a fix for the faint clicking noise heard in some Pixel 2s” as well as the subtle changes to the Pixel 2 XL’s display behavior to mitigate against potential screen burn-in — though those latter changes might not be obvious in normal usage, as a Google community manager writes:</p>

          <h4><a name="#"></a>Google's Files Go app is kind of like AirDrop for Android</a></h4>
            <p>Google appears to be working on a new app called Files Go that’ll work as a way to manage, clean up, and share files. It’s that last one that seems the most interesting here: Files Go seems to have a feature that works a lot like Apple’s AirDrop, letting you easily send files to nearby Android phones over Bluetooth.
            The file-transfer feature doesn’t appear to work quite as smoothly as AirDrop. Both people need to have the Files Go app open, whereas AirDrop lets you send files from any app to any nearby contact, even if they don’t have the same app.
            Still, it’d be a nice addition to Android if Google began shipping this as a stock app. Right now, the best way to send a file to a nearby phone is by using Android Beam, which requires tapping the two phones together to make an NFC connection. It works, but it’s an odd interaction that a lot of people don’t seem to know about. Putting a file-sharing feature inside an app clearly about managing files seems a lot more discoverable.</p>

          <h4><a name="#"></a>Microsoft teases Xbox game streaming within three years</a></h4>
            <p>Microsoft appears to be shifting its Xbox focus to software and services, much like the company’s overall efforts. In an interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft’s head of gaming Phil Spencer explains why the company is focusing more closely on game sales, subscriptions, and other gaming services over pure hardware sales.
            “Now, players are playing the games across every device and we’re connecting those players across all of those devices,” explains Spencer, who was recently promoted to report directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. “Obviously for us, the console is an important part there... but connecting to gamers wherever they are is the vision of Microsoft around what we’re doing in gaming.”
            If that focus on the consumer rather than the hardware sounds familiar, it’s because it’s central to Satya Nadella’s vision for Microsoft. The software giant has been refocusing its efforts in mobile on the reality of how people are using Android and iOS phones instead of Windows-based handsets. Nadella wants Microsoft focused on software and services that are powered by the cloud and follow people no matter what device they’re using. The cloud is now a big part of Microsoft’s overall revenue.</p>

          <h4><a name="#"></a>Here’s the standalone Animoji app Apple should have built.</a></h4>
            <p>Animoji karaoke has been the latest meme to flood social media feeds since the iPhone X was released on Friday. Animoji is fun, essentially transposing your facial gestures onto one of several animated creatures. Unfortunately, it's locked to Apple’s Messages app and limited to ten second clips that can later be saved as a movie files and shared in other apps.
            Now developer Simon B. Støvring has created a standalone app that also doubles clip recordings to 20 seconds, as spotted by 9to5Mac. Støvring’s application is called SBSAnimoji and uses Apple's private APIs. That means it's unlikely the app will be available in the App Store any time soon unless Apple chooses to open up the Animoji APIs to third-party developers.</p>

          <h4><a name="#"></a>Google Assistant can now tell you what song is playing near you.</a></h4>
            <p>Google Assistant can now identify what songs are playing around you, in an update that came today to all devices that have Google Assistant.
            After summoning Google Assistant, you can ask “what song is this?” or “what song is playing?,” and the Assistant will pull up a card for you with the name of the song, the artist, lyrics, and YouTube, Google Play Music (of course), and Spotify streaming links.
            The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have the ability to passively listen in to music around you and identify the song on the screen, but that song identification only kicks in after about a minute of listening and only works on popular songs. Though that feature remains Pixel-only, today’s update adds the ability to identify songs on-demand for everyone with access to the Google Assistant.</p>

          <h4><a name="#"></a>Apple plans to let developers offer discounts on in-app subscriptions</a></h4>
            <p>Apple plans to give developers more freedom over the introductory pricing levels of in-app subscriptions. As referenced in the iOS 11.2 beta release notes, noted by 9to5Mac, Apple plans to expand pricing options from full price and free to include a new, discounted option to entice new subscribers to sign up for a subscription with auto-pay enabled. Prior to today, developers were only allowed to use single-use free trials as an incentivize to get users to enroll in auto-pay. It’s unclear exactly when iOS 11.2 will arrive, but it should be some time in the very near future.
            The change won’t be felt too drastically by users, but it should be a win for developers if they’re able to find a more comfortable middle ground between a free trial and a full-price subscription. Apple has already sweetened the deal for app makers selling subscriptions with a change in App Store policy, instituted last year, that cut subscription revenue from 30 percent down to 15 percent, so long as a user has paid for the subscription for more than 12 months.</p>
